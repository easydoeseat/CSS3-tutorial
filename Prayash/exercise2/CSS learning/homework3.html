                    <h2>What is it</h2>
                    <p>The Lamborghini Centenario is one of the Italian automaker’s finest creations. The car was built to celebrate the centenary of Ferruccio Lamborghini’s birth, the founder, and brains behind the inception of Lamborghini. 
                        As stated before, only 20 coupe and 20 roadster versions of the car will be produced. Unfortunately, all of them have been sold out, the Lamborghini Centenario price, $1,900,000 USD at today’s current exchange rates. Let’s dive in and take a look at the Lamborghini Centenario specs.
                        “The Centenario is a car that perfectly combines tradition and innovation. It looks to the future while honouring the legend that is Ferruccio Lamborghini.” – Automobili Lamborghini President and CEO Stephan Winkelmann.
                        Each one comes with the naturally aspirated V12 engine producing 770 hp, with Lamborghini stating its the most powerful engine they’ve ever produced. It can run the 3,351 lbs car from 0-62 mph in 2.8 seconds and 0-186 mph in 23.5 seconds, with a top speed of over 217 mph. Aiding in the quick acceleration is the permanent four-wheel drive, which includes the new Lamborghini rear-wheel steering system.</p><br>
